## Biography

I am a Professor and Doctoral Supervisor at the School of Artificial Intelligence, Xidian University. I received my Ph.D. degree in Circuits and Systems from Xidian University in 2014 and B.S. degree in Electronic and Information Engineering from Chang'an University in 2008. My research focuses on remote sensing data processing under restricted conditions, particularly breaking through key technologies in spatiotemporal spectral representation of heterogeneous remote sensing data.
